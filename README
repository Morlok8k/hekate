Hekate
******

Hekate is a BitTorrent seeder (informally, a "BitTorrent server", or software
for your "seedbox") designed to handle millions of simultaneous torrents and
tens of thousands of simultaneously connected peers.

Hekate is written in CPC, an experimental concurrent dialect of C. In order to
build Hekate, you will need to install the CPC compiler first. 

Installation
************

To build Hekate, you need to install:

- the CPC compiler [http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~kerneis/software/cpc],
- libcurl,
- libopenssl,
- libpthread (which is required by CPC anyway),

and run:

  make

Known bugs and limitations
**************************

- When listening() fails, trackers and dht continue to run whereas Hekate
  should leave.
- Hekate uses memmap() for every file it serves, and never releases them.  This
  means you need enough virtual memory to hold all your files; this might be an
  issue if you run Hekate on a 32-bits architecture.
- When compiling for exotic architectures (mips, etc.), some uncessary boxing
  is performed.  This is a bug in CPC 0.1, which will be fixed in the next CPC
  release (memcpy is not registered as a "no-retain" function).
